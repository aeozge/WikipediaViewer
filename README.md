This is a project of Intermediate Front End Development Projects in Free Code Camp.

I created this project by using HTML,CSS and JavaScript on Sublime Text.

In this project, I can search through Wikipedia by typing the word I want to search for on the search bar and see the resulting Wikipedia entries. I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
